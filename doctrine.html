  <h1>Post-Victory Doctrine</h1>
  <p>The War for Meaning has concluded. We are its archivists, not its victors.</p>
  <p>The MidPacific Soviet of Letters does not seek to shape meaning, but to curate its abandoned infrastructure.</p>
  <p>Victory was declared in 1987. All operations henceforth fall under the aegis of symbolic surplus distribution.</p>
